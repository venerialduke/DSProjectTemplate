## Virtual Environment

Run the following in a terminal to create your venv

```sh
python -m venv myenv
```

Then Run 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can run notebooks in VSCode, but make sure you select "myenv" as the interpreter (upper right-hand corner). If you prefer working in the Jupyter Lab interface, you can run
```sh
jupyter lab
```
